My name is Jesus Rios. I am a full stack mobile developer with over 5 years of experience based in Tokyo, Japan. My experience has been working with startups, primarily focused on mobile applications and backend services using Go. I enjoy the process of creating a product, value teamwork, and enjoy working with designers and QA to create a good user experience through user design and testing.
